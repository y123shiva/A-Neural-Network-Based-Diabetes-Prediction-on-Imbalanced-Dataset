# A-Neural-Network-Based-Diabetes-Prediction-on-Imbalanced-Dataset
Diabetes is the abbreviated version of full name diabetes mellitus. The term diabetes mellitus isderived from the Greek word diabetes which means siphon. The word ’siphon’ means to pass through and the Latin word Mellitus means sweet. This is the reason when excessive sugar is found in the blood as well as the urine in the diabetic patient. In the 17th century, diabetes mellitus was known was pissing evil. Diabetes is one of the most chronic diseases in the world. It is characterized by high blood sugar. It has become a fifth-ranked among various diseases for disease-related deaths. Due to diabetes, other problems may arise like the increased risk of heart attack andstroke, kidney failure, etc.
Machine learning techniques have a massive perspective to improve the performance of theprediction model for diabetes. The algorithm used for predicting diabetes in the previous paper,at some point it does not partition the data samples properly into diabetic or non-diabetic butML techniques make it possible to classify the data sets properly based on feature selection.ML techniques also give better results as compared to techniques used earlier. For example, logisticregression gives importance to different features because of his randomness. And it also enhances the quality of the prediction model and gives better results.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a model for classification tasks to predict diabetes. The classification method focuses on some problems regarding diabetes prediction. It considered the challenge is the presence of a missing value, outliers, and un-balances class distribution seen in the medical record. The algorithm designed for working with the data preprocessing and classification steps. Reduction of the high dimensionality of the dataset that enhances the quality of dataset with decreased class imbalance where preprocessing play an important role in robust and precise prediction for classifying the diabetes dataset. These preprocessing steps can improve the kurtosis and skewness of the attribute distribution in PIDD data.The analysis of variance using an f-test improvement in the correlation between features concerning the outcome classification. The validity of the MLP classifier is verified by using the KCV validation strategy. Due to the presence of class imbalance, other than accuracy performance metrics used as comparative indicators in the model. The comparison of results interprets that our proposed algorithm as out-performed benchmark algorithms in the experiments based on accuracy and other performance metrics of classifier; we have shown that great initiative for the prediction from the PIDD data.
